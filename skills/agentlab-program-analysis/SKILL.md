# Program analysis maintenance

Analyze the same source commit as semantic knowledge. Record symbols, imports, call candidates, module dependencies, configuration/resource references and available test/build entrypoints as typed `program_facts` rows. Use stable source-derived IDs.

Prefer a language-aware parser/compiler when available. A lexical extractor or name join is useful but must retain its method and unresolved status; a same-name candidate is not resolved dispatch. Record source path/span, analyzer identity and source revision. Keep semantic Skill links explicit.

Run generic MCPGit table programming/search/SQL over fixed input cuts. Archive code, request/bindings, complete typed result and interpretation as analysis rows. Cases reference those analysis IDs. The existing executable SQL example joins call and symbol candidates; it is not a Harmony parser.

Analyze candidate dependency chains and impact surfaces, then hand them to [seed extraction](../agentlab-seed-extraction/SKILL.md). State coverage and gaps such as reflection, dynamic loading, generated code and missing build dependencies only when they affect this source analysis.

Store source/facts/analysis structurally in TableGit. Build trees and temporary binaries belong to SessionFS Workspace snapshots; do not put multi-GB compiler output into Git. Export with [the three-table workflow](../../examples/knowledge-seed/README.md).
