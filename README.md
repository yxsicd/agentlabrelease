# AgentLab Harness releases

Source-free public developer releases for AgentLab, an evaluation Harness for
running, observing, checkpointing, forking, and comparing replaceable Code
Agents.

Current developer preview: `v0.1.0-alpha.9`.

Component-based publication now uses [reference-only environment releases](docs/component-publication.md).
The [e921d102 Linux x64 candidate](release/candidates/e921d102-linux-x64/publication.json)
references independently published packages and records its remaining acceptance
gates. It does not supersede the current developer preview or stable channels.

- Start with [`skills/agentlab-harness-developer/SKILL.md`](skills/agentlab-harness-developer/SKILL.md).
- On AIWSL, start the current preview with
  `scripts/agentlab-harness-quickstart.sh online-install`.
- Read [`RELEASES.md`](RELEASES.md) for version scope and limitations.
- Verify downloaded files with `manifest.json`, `provenance.json`, and
  `SHA256SUMS`.

AgentLab does not redistribute Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, DeepSeek Harness,
or MCPGit. Those remain independently versioned dependencies.

`main` is mutable discovery state. Reproducible consumers must pin an immutable
version tag or full Git commit.
